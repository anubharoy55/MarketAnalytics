The main objective of this project was to identify the most responsive customers before the marketing campaign for agreeing to take the term deposit so that the bank will be able to efficiently reach out probable convertible customers, saving time and marketing resources.

The dataset used had 36168 rows and 17 columns. I have used different statistical methodologies to identify the significance of different features. I had used Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Classifier and Random Forest to train the model. While traiing the model, the best performing algorithm was Random Forest with an accuracy of 96%. While testing the data I was able to get an accuracy of 82%
